    "# Class and Object are two important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A class is a blueprint or a prototype that defines the variables and methods              common to all objects of a particular type. It is a template for creating objects,        and acts as a blue print for objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has state and         behavior. An object is an individual unit of a class, and it can be manipulated           and interacted with through the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the scenario of a dog. A dog has certain characteristics (color, breed, name, etc.) and behavior (barking, wagging tail, etc.). This can be represented in OOP using a class called \"Dog\". The class defines the variables (color, breed, name) and methods (bark, wag_tail) that are common to all dogs. An object of the class \"Dog\" can then be created for each individual dog, such as \"my_dog\" or \"your_dog\". These objects will have their own unique values for the variables and can use the methods defined in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, a class defines the properties and behaviors of an object, and an object is an instance of a class."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing              only the necessary information to the user. This allows the user to focus on              what the object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code                  that operates on the data (methods) within a single unit, or object. It                  protects the data from outside interference and misuse, and it is one of                  the main concepts behind the idea of \"data hiding\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit the properties              and behaviors of an existing class. The new class is called a derived class,              or child class, and the existing class is called the base class, or parent                class. This mechanism provides a way to reuse code, reduce complexity and                make it easier to create and maintain a large software system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. In other                 words, an object can be dynamically cast to any of its related classes                   during runtime, and it can respond to the same method call in different                   ways, depending on the context. This enables an object to perform a single               task in different ways, making the code more flexible and efficient.\n",
