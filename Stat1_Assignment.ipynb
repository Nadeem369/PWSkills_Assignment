    "These measures of central tendency and variability are fundamental in statistical analysis and data interpretation. They help us describe the key characteristics of datasets, assess their variability, and make comparisons between different sets of data. The choice of which measure to use often depends on the nature of the data and the specific questions you want to answer."
